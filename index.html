         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hey there! I'm George(nexus), a full-stack developer with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Lua and C++ for the back-end. I've worked on various projects that involve creating dynamic and interactive websites, as well as developing Game Uis and building scalable Projects.</p>
         <p>My passion for coding began with a curiosity for how things work, and I've been honing my skills ever since. I'm a fast learner, a problem solver, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
         <p>Feel free to take a look at my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any opportunities.</p>
